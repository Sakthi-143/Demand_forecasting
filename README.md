## 🎯 Introduction

### Purpose
The **Demand Forecasting Tool** is a Streamlit-based application designed to predict product demand using time-series analysis. It provides insights into sales trends, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions about inventory and product management.

### Target Audience
This tool is intended for:
- 🧑‍💻 Data Scientists
- 📈 Business Analysts
- 📦 Supply Chain Managers

## 💻 Technical Overview

### Development Environment
- **Language:** Python 🐍
- **Framework:** Streamlit
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `prophet`, `plotly`

### Data Handling
- Merges transactional data for seamless analysis 🧩
- Handles datetime parsing and data cleaning efficiently 🧹

## 🚀 Core Functionalities

### Demand Forecasting
- **File Uploads:** Supports uploading CSV files for transactional data and product information.
- **Data Visualization:** Displays predicted demand using interactive charts.
- **Error Analysis:** Provides error distribution plots for deeper insights.

### Time-Series Analysis
- Uses the **Prophet** model to forecast future demand trends.
- Visualizes both historical and predicted demand.

## 🧩 Implementation Details

### Data Preprocessing
- Combines multiple datasets (transactional and product data) for a comprehensive analysis.
- Filters data based on user-selected date ranges.

### Machine Learning Model
- Implements the **Prophet** time-series forecasting model.
- Splits data into training and testing sets for accurate evaluation.

### Visualization Techniques
- Uses **Plotly** for interactive line charts.
- Utilizes **Seaborn** for error distribution plots.

## 📈 Data Analysis Techniques

### 1. Demand Forecasting with Prophet
- **Training and Testing Split:** Divides data for model evaluation.
- **Future Predictions:** Extends predictions beyond the existing data.

### 2. Error Analysis
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** are used to evaluate model performance.
- Visualizes error distributions for both training and testing datasets.

## 📊 Model Performance Metrics

### Training Performance
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error): Measures average prediction error.
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error): Highlights prediction accuracy.

### Testing Performance
- Compares the model's predictions against unseen data for validation.

## 👍 Advantages & ⚠️ Limitations

### Advantages
- **Interactive User Interface**: Easy-to-use Streamlit app 💡
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Provides both demand predictions and error analysis 📊
- **Flexibility**: Handles multiple data formats seamlessly 📑

### Limitations
- Limited to basic time-series forecasting algorithms 🛠️
- Requires well-structured data for accurate predictions 🚧

## 🔧 Potential Enhancements

- **Additional Machine Learning Models**: Incorporate models like **ARIMA** or **LSTM** for improved forecasting.
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Use interactive libraries like **Plotly** for more engaging charts.
- **Feature Engineering**: Add features like seasonality or promotional impacts on demand.
